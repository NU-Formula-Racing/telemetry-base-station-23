Simple local program to test the PlatformIO (PIO) DE as well as compiling for the Teensy using NFR's custom CAN library.

PIO automates dependency management, this is managed via the platformio.ini file. This does not absolve dependency inclusion in programs to use their contents, with some dependencies requiring inclusion to build properly.
