`telemetry.h` condenses external includes, hardware pin and freq configurations,
global vars, and task functions into a unified template file.

The `packetnum` var can be used both for debugging and packet ordering
in case the full CAN requires more than one packet to transmit.

Its implementation is found in `src/telemetry.cpp`.

`target.h` sets the compilation macro to determine for which device to compile for.
It includes 2 macros; uncomment exactly **one** to specify device, as some libraries
will not work without the matching hardware.

`ser_des.h` contains serializer and deserializer functions to prepare data
for LoRa data packets. Its implementation can be found in ser_des.cpp.
