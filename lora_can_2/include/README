`telemetry.h` condenses external includes, hardware pin and freq configurations,
global vars, and task functions into a unified template file.

The `packetnum` var can be used both for debugging and packet ordering
in case the full CAN requires more than one packet to transmit.

Its implementation is found in `src/telemetry.cpp`.
