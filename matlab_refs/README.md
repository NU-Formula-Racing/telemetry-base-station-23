Copies of MATLAB work used to perform analysis of designs, output, and test results
at a higher level than would be permitted on the Teensy devices used elsewhere.

Each file is designed to be self-sufficient, with no need for external sources unless specified. Documentation and functionality is provided in each script file.

Note that these are mostly meant for internal use by the main contributor of this directory,
so complete user-friendliness, documentation, or scalability should not be expected.

To contributors: remember to update this directory  by copying the scripts stored
locally to this file to publish on the NFR Github. An example command to copy all scripts
to this directory is given below for a Unix-based system:

	`cp <local MATLAB folder>/*.m .`

Make sure to run this command in this directory path and using your own folder.
