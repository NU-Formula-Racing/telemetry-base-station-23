This project encompasses a series of tests to study and optimize the physical timing constraints for LoRa and the comms program.
In particular, it exists to maximise the rate of reception, minimise the rate of transmission, and synchronise multiple-timers.
Their description and results are described below:

1) Packet size test: determine how packet size of transmission affects the rate
-  The program has been reduced to a simple comm program akin to a template for testing a communication channel.
   The TX still ticks a CAN bus, but only transmits a packet number (`packetnum`) + initial data in its `packet`.
   The send buffer size is arbitrarily specified within the program and is the controlled variable for testing.
   The first delay prior to sending data is commented out for potential maximisation of speed.
   The RX simply receives the buffer, prints out its size, and prints the `packetnum`.

-  The receiver runs at 1 ms (ideally), and the transceiver runs at 1 s.

-  The buffer size is varied, and the output on the TX is monitored over time with both the output data and time elapsed recorded.
   Once sufficient time has passed, transmission stops and both the elapsed time and `packetnum` of final message are recorded.
   From there, the rate of transmission, or the number of messages per second, is recorded.

-  This test assumes that transmission time is ignored if a receiver does not obtain its message. It also assumes that the 10 ms
   delay in the TX does not dominate transmission time.

-  Results of this test are written below:

| Packet size | Time elapsed (s) | Max packetnum | Rate (#/s) |

| 32          |  |  |  |
